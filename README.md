 This code, made from starter code provided by instructors/the bootcamp, uses jquery to create a planner of events for a single work day. 
 The date is dynamically updated and displayed at the top of the page and the hours are time sensitively color-coded to show past, present, and future.
 Upon load stored events are checked and filled out, events can be entered and saved by the hour
